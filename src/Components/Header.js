      My curiosity with tech started early–I was networking computers together in middle school so my friends and I could play video games. That turned into an internship at an internet startup during high school, during which I self-taught programming basics. Out of college, I chose a career in the humanities, achieved ABD for a PhD in philosophy of religion and founded a tutoring company. Now that I’m back in tech, I’m excited to bring my love of learning, collaboration, and scrappy work ethic to my coding career. I’m really proud of Earworm, a “name that tune” game that I built with React.js, Ruby on Rails, and Spotify APIs, and I also recently bought a Raspberry Pi to learn Linux and set up a video server for my 3-year-old (mostly Peppa Pig). I’d love to work at a company where diversity matters, where anyone can have a business impact, and where continuous learning is a core value.
